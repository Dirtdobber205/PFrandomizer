# PHANTOM FORCES RANDOMIZER BY DUODECA

Thank you for using the PF loadout randomizer project made by DuoDeca.

## Some things that must be noted:
> This project is not even close to completion and might not be fully complete for a very long time.
>> This does not include adding newly released weapons. Those will be added whenever the game is updated.
> Some loadouts that you will see when using the randomizer __WILL BE INCOMPATIBLE!__ (e.g. SFG 50 with Half Ring Sight, Osprey Suppressor and 33rd Magazine.)
>> In these cases, just ignore them and either use no attachment for the incompatible slot(s), or just reroll.
> Unique attachments have been disabled to reduce the chances of getting an incompatible loadout. (No PSO-1M2 Scope or Boom Stock or any of that sort of thing.)

## Upcoming features that are planned to be added in the near future:
> Select-all checkbox for melee weapons so users don't have to manually check every checkbox for all the melee weapons they own.
>> In addition, remove the Crowbar from the checklist and make it a default alongside the Knife.
>> Possibly also associate the melee weapons that can be unlocked via rank to behave as such?
> Dark/light theme switcher for those who are into that sort of thing and want to blind themselves with white colors.
> Navigation box containing links to StyLiS related platforms and social media accounts.
> Displaying a history log of previous loadout rolls to user.
